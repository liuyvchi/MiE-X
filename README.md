# MiE-X

## Introduction

This is an implementation of MiE-X by Pytorch. MiE-X is a large-scale synthetic dataset that improves data-driven micro-expression methods. MiE-X introduces three types of effective Actions Units (AUs) that constitute trainable micro-expressions. This repository provides the implementation of acquiring these AUs and using these AUs to obtain MiE-X.
